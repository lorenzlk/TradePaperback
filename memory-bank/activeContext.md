# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
**Status:** Deployment & Testing - Ready for Mobile Testing

**Current Phase:** Deploy and test on actual devices

**Next Immediate Steps:**
1. ✅ Complete Memory Bank documentation setup
2. ✅ Set up Pipedream webhook endpoint  
3. ✅ Test webhook successfully (200 OK)
4. ✅ Complete Google Sheets integration in Pipedream
5. ✅ Build frontend scanner app
6. 🔄 Deploy to Vercel (NEXT STEP - User's Choice)
   - Push to GitHub
   - Connect Vercel to repository
   - Deploy with one click
   - Get live URL
7. Test on actual mobile devices (iOS & Android)
8. Verify end-to-end flow (scan → webhook → sheet)

## Recent Changes (Last Session)
- ✅ Created Memory Bank structure (6 core files)
- ✅ Documented project requirements from PRD (prd.md)
- ✅ Defined system architecture and patterns
- ✅ Established technical stack and constraints
- ✅ Created comprehensive Pipedream setup guide (pipedream-setup.md)
- ✅ Built interactive webhook testing tool (test-webhook.html)
- ✅ Configured Pipedream webhook (https://eo76brlwpbpr9el.m.pipedream.net)
- ✅ Successfully tested webhook endpoint (200 OK response verified)
- ✅ Created Google Sheet "Trade Paperback DB"
- ✅ Documented Google Sheets integration process (google-sheets-setup.md)
- ✅ Saved all configuration to config.js (webhook URL, sheet ID)
- ✅ Updated Memory Bank across all files

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **No build process initially** - Keep it simple with vanilla JS loaded from CDN
2. **Pipedream for backend** - Fastest path to working data pipeline
3. **Mobile-first approach** - Design for phone screens primarily
4. **Zero authentication** - Optimize for friction-free experience

### Open Questions
- [ ] Which hosting platform? (Netlify vs. Vercel vs. GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Which data destination? (Google Sheets, Airtable, or Supabase)
- [ ] Geolocation permission strategy (ask upfront or make optional?)
- [ ] Domain name (upcscan.app or similar)
- [ ] Visual feedback style (flash, checkmark, haptic only?)

### Decisions Made Recently
- ✅ **Pipedream webhook URL:** https://eo76brlwpbpr9el.m.pipedream.net
- ✅ **Data destination:** Google Sheets
- ✅ **Google Sheet:** Trade Paperback DB (ID: 1NIbYNYHdnuksYUDfPUQMExmPTpETvmqlu8WZVr4F_ck)
- ✅ **Sheet columns defined:** UPC, Timestamp, Device, Browser, Latitude, Longitude, Session ID
- ✅ **Hosting platform:** Vercel (user's choice)

### Current Status
- ✅ Webhook tested successfully (200 OK)
- ✅ Pipedream receiving data correctly
- ✅ Google Sheets integration complete
- ✅ End-to-end backend tested (webhook → Pipedream → Sheet)
- ✅ Frontend scanner app built (index.html, scanner.js, styles.css)
- ✅ All core features implemented
- 🔄 Ready for deployment and mobile testing

### Technical Considerations
- **Camera initialization timing** - iOS Safari may need user gesture
- **Frame processing throttle** - Every frame vs. every Nth frame
- **Duplicate prevention** - How long to wait before allowing same barcode again?
- **Error recovery** - When should user be prompted vs. auto-retry?

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style Preferences
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript (async/await, arrow functions)
- Minimal dependencies (only @zxing/browser)
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Comments for complex logic only

### UX Preferences
- **Immediate action** - No unnecessary screens or clicks
- **Clear feedback** - Visual confirmation of every scan
- **Fail gracefully** - Helpful error messages, not technical jargon
- **Continuous operation** - Stay ready for next scan

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Insights So Far
1. **Speed is critical** - Every millisecond matters for the "instant" experience
2. **Mobile camera quirks** - iOS and Android have different behaviors (will learn more during testing)
3. **Network reliability** - Must handle offline gracefully
4. **Battery considerations** - Continuous video processing drains battery
5. **Pipedream simplicity** - Webhook setup was straightforward; testing tool proved invaluable
6. **Documentation value** - Memory Bank structure keeps everything organized from day one

### Best Practices Emerging
- Test webhooks early with dedicated testing tool
- Use Pipedream Event History for debugging data flow
- Document setup steps as we go (helps with troubleshooting)
- Keep configuration centralized in config.js
- Test on real devices early and often (upcoming)
- Log everything to Pipedream for debugging
- Keep UI minimal - less to load, less to break

## Current Blockers
**None currently** - Project is in setup phase

## Context for Next Session
When resuming work:
1. **Review this activeContext.md** for current state
2. **Check progress.md** for completed features and current tasks
3. **Reference systemPatterns.md** for architecture decisions

**Backend Status:**
- ✅ Webhook is live and tested (200 OK)
- 🔄 User needs to complete Google Sheets integration in Pipedream
- ⏳ Awaiting confirmation that data flows into Google Sheet

**Next Priority After Backend Complete:**
1. Build frontend scanner app (index.html, scanner.js, styles.css)
2. Implement camera initialization with getUserMedia()
3. Integrate @zxing/browser for barcode detection
4. Deploy to hosting platform with HTTPS
5. Test on actual mobile devices

## Quick Reference

### Success Criteria Reminder
- ✅ Page load to camera active: < 2 seconds
- ✅ Scan accuracy: ≥ 95%
- ✅ Data delivery: ≤ 500ms
- ✅ Works on iOS Safari + Android Chrome

### Essential URLs
- **Pipedream webhook:** https://eo76brlwpbpr9el.m.pipedream.net
- **Google Sheet:** https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NIbYNYHdnuksYUDfPUQMExmPTpETvmqlu8WZVr4F_ck/edit
- **Sheet ID:** 1NIbYNYHdnuksYUDfPUQMExmPTpETvmqlu8WZVr4F_ck
- Production URL: TBD (awaiting hosting platform decision)
- GitHub repo: TBD
- Documentation: Memory Bank (complete)

### Priority Features (Phase 1)
1. Camera activation ⚡ CRITICAL
2. UPC barcode detection ⚡ CRITICAL
3. Auto submission ⚡ CRITICAL
4. Metadata capture ⚡ CRITICAL
5. Visual feedback 🎯 IMPORTANT
