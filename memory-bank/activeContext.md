## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Architecture Decisions Made
1. **No build process initially** - Keep it simple with vanilla JS loaded from CDN
2. **Pipedream for backend** - Fastest path to working data pipeline
3. **Mobile-first approach** - Design for phone screens primarily
4. **Zero authentication** - Optimize for friction-free experience

### Open Questions
- [ ] Which hosting platform? (Netlify vs. Vercel vs. GitHub Pages)
- [ ] Which data destination? (Google Sheets, Airtable, or Supabase)
- [ ] Geolocation permission strategy (ask upfront or make optional?)
- [ ] Domain name (upcscan.app or similar)
- [ ] Visual feedback style (flash, checkmark, haptic only?)

### Decisions Made Recently
- ✅ **Pipedream webhook URL:** https://eo76brlwpbpr9el.m.pipedream.net
- ✅ **Data destination:** Google Sheets
- ✅ **Google Sheet:** Trade Paperback DB (ID: 1NIbYNYHdnuksYUDfPUQMExmPTpETvmqlu8WZVr4F_ck)
- ✅ **Sheet1 columns:** UPC, Timestamp, Device, Browser, Latitude, Longitude, Session ID
- ✅ **Sheet2 columns (16):** UPC, Timestamp, Title, Publisher, Release_Date, Format, Series, Volume_Issue, Page_Count, ISBN, Price_USD, Genre, Description, Cover_Image_URL, Goodreads_Rating, Data_Source
- ✅ **Hosting platform:** Vercel (deployed at trade-paperback.vercel.app)
- ✅ **Scanner implementation:** Manual frame capture loop (most reliable)
- ✅ **LLM for enrichment:** GPT-4o with OpenLibrary + Google Books APIs

### Current Status
- ✅ **Scanner WORKING!** Fully functional on mobile
- ✅ Barcode detection confirmed with manual frame capture
- ✅ Manual entry fallback available for difficult barcodes
- ✅ End-to-end flow verified (scan → webhook → Sheet1)
- ✅ Deployed to Vercel (trade-paperback.vercel.app)
- ✅ All Phase 1 features complete and tested
- ✅ **Phase 2A COMPLETE:** On-screen metadata confirmation card
  - Shows UPC, format, and timestamp after each scan
  - Auto-dismisses after 5 seconds or user can close manually
  - Beautiful green-themed card with smooth animations
- ✅ **Phase 2B documentation COMPLETE:** Sheet2 metadata enrichment with LLM
- ✅ Comprehensive Pipedream enrichment workflow guide created
- 🔄 **Next step:** Implement enrichment workflow in Pipedream, then connect to metadata card

### Technical Considerations
- **Camera initialization timing** - iOS Safari may need user gesture
- **Frame processing throttle** - Every frame vs. every Nth frame
- **Duplicate prevention** - How long to wait before allowing same barcode again?
- **Error recovery** - When should user be prompted vs. auto-retry?

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Style Preferences
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript (async/await, arrow functions)
- Minimal dependencies (only @zxing/browser)
- Clear, descriptive variable names
- Comments for complex logic only

### UX Preferences
- **Immediate action** - No unnecessary screens or clicks
- **Clear feedback** - Visual confirmation of every scan
- **Fail gracefully** - Helpful error messages, not technical jargon
- **Continuous operation** - Stay ready for next scan

## Learnings & Project Insights

### Key Insights So Far
1. **Speed is critical** - Every millisecond matters for the "instant" experience
2. **Mobile camera quirks** - iOS and Android have different behaviors (will learn more during testing)
3. **Network reliability** - Must handle offline gracefully
4. **Battery considerations** - Continuous video processing drains battery
5. **Pipedream simplicity** - Webhook setup was straightforward; testing tool proved invaluable
6. **Documentation value** - Memory Bank structure keeps everything organized from day one

### Best Practices Emerging
- Test webhooks early with dedicated testing tool
- Use Pipedream Event History for debugging data flow
- Document setup steps as we go (helps with troubleshooting)
- Keep configuration centralized in config.js
- Test on real devices early and often (upcoming)
- Log everything to Pipedream for debugging
- Keep UI minimal - less to load, less to break

## Current Blockers
**None currently** - Project is in setup phase

## Context for Next Session
When resuming work:
1. **Review this activeContext.md** for current state
2. **Check progress.md** for completed features and current tasks
3. **Reference systemPatterns.md** for architecture decisions

**Backend Status:**
- ✅ Webhook is live and tested (200 OK)
- 🔄 User needs to complete Google Sheets integration in Pipedream
- ⏳ Awaiting confirmation that data flows into Google Sheet

**Next Priority After Backend Complete:**
1. Build frontend scanner app (index.html, scanner.js, styles.css)
2. Implement camera initialization with getUserMedia()
3. Integrate @zxing/browser for barcode detection
4. Deploy to hosting platform with HTTPS
5. Test on actual mobile devices
