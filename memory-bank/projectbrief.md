# Project Brief: Lightweight Mobile UPC Scanner

## Project Name
TradePaperback - Lightweight Mobile UPC Scanner

## Overview
A browser-based web app that enables instant, frictionless barcode capture on mobile devices. When opened, it immediately launches the camera, detects UPC barcodes, captures essential metadata, and sends data to a backend endpoint for aggregation and analysis.

## Core Purpose
Enable fast, reliable product cataloging or data collection without requiring a native app or installation.

## Key Goals
- **Instant Access:** Open-to-scan in under 2 seconds
- **Zero-Friction UX:** No sign-up, downloads, or menus
- **Accurate Scanning:** 95%+ successful UPC reads under normal lighting
- **Reliable Data Pipeline:** All scans transmitted and stored with no loss
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Works on both iOS Safari and Android Chrome

## Target Users
1. **Internal Testers** - Early internal team or QA testers for rapid product/UPC cataloging
2. **Field Operators** - Staff scanning physical products in warehouse, retail, or sample testing
3. **Developers** - Integrators or analysts accessing the collected data

## Primary Use Cases
1. Quick Product Scanning (open → scan → submit → repeat)
2. Field Data Logging (capture UPCs and metadata in real time)
3. Automated Catalog Input (feed scanned codes into product databases)

## Success Metrics
- Time from page load to first scan: < 2 seconds
- Barcode detection accuracy: 95%+
- Data transmission success rate: 99%+
- Cross-browser compatibility: iOS Safari + Android Chrome

## Project Constraints
- Must be browser-based (no native app)
- Must work without user authentication
- Must minimize infrastructure complexity
- No video/image data storage (privacy)
