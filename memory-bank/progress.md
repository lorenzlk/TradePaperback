## üîÑ Evolution of Project Decisions

### Initial Decisions (October 2025)
1. **Vanilla JavaScript chosen over frameworks**
   - Rationale: Optimize for load time, minimize complexity
   - Status: Confirmed

2. **Pipedream for backend**
   - Rationale: Zero infrastructure, fast setup, built-in integrations
   - Status: Confirmed

3. **No authentication in Phase 1**
   - Rationale: Minimize friction, suitable for internal use
   - Status: Confirmed, may revisit for production scale

4. **Mobile-first design**
   - Rationale: Primary use case is phone-based scanning
   - Status: Confirmed

### Decisions to Be Made
- Hosting platform selection
- Exact visual feedback mechanism
- Geolocation inclusion strategy
- Domain name and branding
