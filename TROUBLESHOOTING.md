# üì± Troubleshooting Barcode Detection

## Common Issues with Comic Book UPCs

### Issue: Scanner doesn't detect anything

#### Quick Fixes

1. **Check Browser Console** (Enable DEBUG_MODE)
   - Open browser DevTools (F12 on desktop, or Safari DevTools on iOS)
   - Look for messages starting with üîç or ‚ö†Ô∏è
   - Should see "Scan attempts: X (still scanning...)" every few seconds

2. **Improve Lighting**
   - Comic books often have glossy covers
   - Move to bright, diffused light (near window, under lamp)
   - Avoid direct harsh light that creates glare
   - Try different angles to reduce reflections

3. **Distance & Focus**
   - Hold phone **6-10 inches** from barcode
   - Keep phone steady (rest on table if needed)
   - Wait 2-3 seconds for camera to focus
   - Move slowly closer/farther to find sweet spot

4. **Barcode Condition**
   - Ensure barcode isn't damaged or wrinkled
   - Check if barcode is partially covered by sticker/price tag
   - Some comic books have very small UPCs (harder to scan)
   - Try scanning ISBN barcode instead (usually larger)

5. **Camera Issues**
   - Verify camera isn't being used by another app
   - Clean camera lens with soft cloth
   - Ensure adequate phone brightness
   - Try reloading the page

## Comic Book Barcode Tips

### Comic Book UPC Characteristics

Comic books typically have:
- **Small barcodes** (smaller than grocery items)
- **Glossy covers** (causes reflections)
- **Curved surfaces** (bent/rolled issues)
- **Two barcodes sometimes**:
  - Main UPC (product code)
  - Issue number barcode (smaller)

### Best Scanning Practices

1. **Flatten the book**
   - Place on flat surface
   - Hold edges flat
   - Avoid bent/curved spine area

2. **Optimal Angle**
   - Hold phone parallel to barcode
   - Not too close (blur)
   - Not too far (too small)
   - **Sweet spot: 6-8 inches**

3. **Lighting Setup**
   - Indirect/ambient light best
   - Avoid direct overhead lights
   - Natural daylight works great
   - Tilt book to reduce glare

4. **Which Barcode to Scan**
   - Scan the **larger UPC** (main product code)
   - Ignore smaller issue number barcode
   - Some comics have both on same side

## Debug Mode

### Enable Debug Mode

Edit `config.js`:
```javascript
DEBUG_MODE: true
```

Redeploy or reload the page.

### What to Check

Open browser console and look for:

**Good signs:**
```
üöÄ Initializing UPC Scanner...
‚úÖ Camera initialized successfully
üîç Starting barcode detection...
‚úÖ Barcode detection started successfully
üîç Scan attempts: 50 (still scanning...)
üîç Scan attempts: 100 (still scanning...)
```

**Problems:**
```
‚ùå Failed to start barcode detection
‚ö†Ô∏è Decode error: [error name]
```

### Common Error Messages

**"NotAllowedError"**
- Camera permission denied
- Solution: Allow camera in browser settings

**"NotFoundError"**
- No camera available
- Solution: Use device with camera

**"NotFoundException"** (in console, normal)
- No barcode currently in frame
- This is NORMAL - keep scanning

**ZXing undefined**
- Library not loaded
- Solution: Check internet connection, reload page

## Testing Procedure

### Step-by-Step Test

1. **Open DevTools Console**
   - Desktop: F12
   - iOS Safari: Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Advanced ‚Üí Web Inspector
   - Android Chrome: chrome://inspect

2. **Load the App**
   - You should see initialization messages
   - Confirm "Barcode detection started successfully"

3. **Point at Barcode**
   - Hold steady for 3-5 seconds
   - Watch console for scan attempts
   - Should increment: 50, 100, 150...

4. **Try Different Conditions**
   - Different lighting
   - Different distances
   - Different angles
   - Different barcodes

## Alternative Test UPCs

If comic book barcodes aren't working, test with these:

### Easier to Scan (Larger Barcodes)
- Cereal box
- Soda can/bottle
- Packaged food items
- Books (ISBN)

### If These Work
- Your scanner is working correctly
- Issue is specific to comic book UPCs (small/glossy)
- Try tips above for comic-specific scanning

### If These Don't Work
- Check console for errors
- Verify ZXing library loaded
- Check camera permissions
- Try different device/browser

---

## Technical Checks

### Verify ZXing Library

In console, type:
```javascript
typeof ZXing
```

Should return: `"object"`

If `"undefined"`: Library not loaded, check internet connection

### Check Video Stream

In console:
```javascript
document.getElementById('video').videoWidth
```

Should return a number (e.g., 1920)

If `0`: Camera stream not active

### Manual Test

Try this in console:
```javascript
const reader = new ZXing.BrowserMultiFormatReader();
console.log('ZXing initialized:', reader);
```

Should log the reader object, not an error.

## Browser-Specific Issues

### iOS Safari

**Issues:**
- Sometimes camera needs page reload
- May need user gesture to start
- Video must be visible on screen

**Solutions:**
- Reload page if camera stuck
- Tap screen if nothing happens
- Don't minimize app while scanning

### Android Chrome

**Issues:**
- Camera quality varies by device
- Some devices have slower autofocus
- Vendor-specific camera implementations

**Solutions:**
- Wait longer for focus (3-5 seconds)
- Try manual focus (tap screen)
- Update Chrome to latest version

---

## Still Not Working?

### Collect Debug Info

1. Enable `DEBUG_MODE: true`
2. Open console
3. Copy all console messages
4. Note:
   - Device type (iPhone 15, Pixel 8, etc.)
   - Browser version
   - What barcode you're trying to scan
   - What happens (nothing, error, etc.)

### Check Deployment

1. Verify app is served over HTTPS
   - URL should start with `https://`
   - Camera won't work on HTTP

2. Verify ZXing loads
   - Check Network tab in DevTools
   - Look for `@zxing/library` request
   - Should be 200 OK status

3. Test webhook
   - Use `test-webhook.html`
   - Verify backend is receiving data
   - Isolates issue to scanning vs. data flow

---

## Potential Improvements

If scanning is consistently difficult:

1. **Add manual entry option**
   - Type UPC if scanning fails
   - Backup method for damaged barcodes

2. **Add zoom/crop feature**
   - Zoom in on small barcodes
   - Better for comic books

3. **Add flash/torch control**
   - Better for low light
   - Reduces glare on glossy covers

4. **Try different library**
   - QuaggaJS (alternative)
   - Native Barcode Detection API (limited support)

---

## Contact Support

If you've tried everything:

1. Check GitHub Issues
2. Create new issue with:
   - Device info
   - Browser version
   - Console logs (with DEBUG_MODE)
   - Photo of barcode you're trying to scan
   - What happens (or doesn't happen)
